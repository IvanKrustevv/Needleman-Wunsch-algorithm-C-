                <TextBlock Text="The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide&#x0a;sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences.&#x0a;The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970.&#x0a;The algorithm essentially divides a large problem into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions &#x0a;to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem.&#x0a;It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. &#x0a;The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when &#x0a;the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance."
